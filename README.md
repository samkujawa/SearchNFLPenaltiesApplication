Project Title: NFL Penalties Database GUI

Description:
I developed a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application to interact with an NFL penalties database stored in MySQL. This project allows users to search for player penalties, view game data, and log new penalty records directly into the database.

Key Features:

- Player Penalty Search: Users can search for penalties associated with specific NFL players using a search bar and a dropdown menu to filter results by year.
- Game Data Search: The application allows users to search for specific games based on the date, home team, and away team. It returns detailed information such as the number of accepted penalties during those games.
- Logging Penalties: Users can input new penalty data, including player name, penalty description, yardage, and game details, which are then inserted into the databaseâ€™s log and players tables.
- Dynamic GUI: Built using Java Swing, the interface is user-friendly with various fields, dropdowns, buttons, and text areas to facilitate interaction with the database.

Technical Details:

- Java Swing: Used for creating the interactive user interface.
- MySQL Database: The backend database stores player and game information. SQL queries handle data retrieval and insertion.
- Prepared Statements: Secure database interactions are implemented using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Dynamic Querying: Depending on user inputs, SQL queries are dynamically built and executed, ensuring flexibility in search functionalities.

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate a relational database with a Java application and create an interactive GUI for data management and retrieval, showcasing my skills in Java, SQL, and software development.
